# Submissions

Create your own subfolder inside `/submissions` (make sure to give it a unique name). Your submissions should contain the following files and information:

- `README.md`: with a description of your project, requirements, installation guide, and how to run it. You can also record a video and upload to Youtube. Although that's optional, it'll be a nice touch ðŸ˜‰
- `About.md`: include here information about yourself and how to contact you.
- `/code`: create a subfolder with all the code of your submissions.
