In this repository you'll find all the information you need to participate in the zkSync track of ETHLisbon 2022 Hackathon.

## Dates

ETH Lisbon kicks-off on October 28th. Although the official hackathon ends on 30th October, we've decided to extend the submission period a few more days (final date to be decided).

## Who can participate?

Anyone can participate, no matter if you're attending ETHLisbon in person or not. We'll create a **specific channel in [our Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/px2aR7w)** to talk and help buidlers that decide to participate online.

## Prizes

TBD

## Bounty

We're asking developers to work with one of the coolest features of zkSync v2: **account abstraction**.

We'll reward the best / most creative uses of this feature and we're giving you total freedom so you can focus on social recovery, multicalls, paymasters or whatever you want!

## How to send your submission

To send a submissions, just fork this repo and create a PR with your changes. You should create your own subfolder inside `/submissions` (make sure to give it a unique name). Your submissions should contain the following files and information:

- `README.md`: with a description of your project, requirements, installation guide, and how to run it. You can also record a video and upload to Youtube. Although that's optional, it'll be a nice touch 😉
- `About.md`: include here information about yourself and how to contact you.
- `/code`: create a subfolder with all the code of your submissions.
