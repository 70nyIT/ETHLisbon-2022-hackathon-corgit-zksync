## Prizes

The top three projects will receive a prize amount of $1000 for a total of $3000 in bounties.

## Bounty

We're asking developers to work with one of the coolest features of zkSync v2: **account abstraction**.

We'll reward the best / most creative uses of this feature and we're giving you total freedom so you can focus on social recovery, multicalls, paymasters or whatever you want!
